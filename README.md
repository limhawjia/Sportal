Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11


# **_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Sportal</span>_**

An all-in-one Android app to solve all your sports match-finding needs


## **_<span style="text-decoration:underline;">IDEATION</span>_**


### **Problem Motivation**:

	

There are several problems currently faced by people who frequently play/have a desire to play sports:



*   Not enough players to form a full game of a team sport
*   Finding pickup games can be messy and disorganized
*   Difficult for new players of a sport to find actual opportunities to play
*   Difficulties in scheduling a proper game and managing the list of players who can make it 
*   Hard to find a group of like-minded individuals to be able to play a sport you enjoy together

As of present, we feel like there is a lack of a centralized platform for sports players to arrange and find proper matches with other players. In addition,  if you want to organize a match, you have to coordinate time, location, and other details with all players and manage a list of who can make it, as well as disseminate important information with the players attending. 


### **Aim**:

Our objective is to provide a service that addresses the above issues in an Android application that emphasizes convenience and ease-of-use by:



1. Providing said centralized platform for players to set-up and join games.
2. Providing an integrated service to communicate, coordinate and manage all details regarding the game.


### **User Stories:**



1. As a match organizer who already has a venue and some/zero players already interested in playing, I want to be able to easily find more players to make up the amount needed to start a proper game.
2. As a sport player, I want to be able to quickly find a joinable match that conforms to my constraints, such as time and location requirements.
3. As a new sport player, I want to be able to find matches of the appropriate skill level which are also welcoming of new players.
4. As a sport player/match organizer, I want to be able to easily communicate with players in the same game as me to settle details or simply have a chat.
5. As a sports venue owner, I can promote my venue to groups of sport players by organizing matches when my venue is unbooked.
